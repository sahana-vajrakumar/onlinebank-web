To access app visit: 'https://onlinebank-web.herokuapp.com/'

 Brief description: This app is a online banking website. It lets the user login/signup and view information such as accounts and personal info. User can also do transaction such as withdraw and deposit. The transaction will be reflected in transaction history. User can also view the graphical representation of his transactions based on amount and date. This app also has add account and delete account feature , which is not ideal for real world case. But I have added it just to get my hands on entire CRUD system.





Software used: Rails 4
Ruby 2.3.3
PostgreSQL
Jquery
Bootstrap
Heroku for deploying the site
Highchart for graphical representation of the transaction info.



Bugs and To do list.

Home page is just for display. Only login and signup has functionality.
Needs a more detailed graph
Need to add CSS to make few pages, such as forms presentable.
